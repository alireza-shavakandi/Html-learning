        <p>"Fat Man" (also known as Mark III) is the codename for the type of nuclear bomb that was detonated over the
          Japanese city of Nagasaki by the United States on 9 August 1945. It was the second of the only two nuclear
          weapons
          ever used in warfare, the first being Little Boy, and its detonation marked the third nuclear explosion in
          history. It was built by scientists and engineers at Los Alamos Laboratory using plutonium from the Hanford
          Site,
          and it was dropped from the Boeing B-29 Superfortress Bockscar piloted by Major Charles Sweeney.
          The name Fat Man refers to the early design of the bomb because it had a wide, round shape. Fat Man was an
          implosion-type nuclear weapon with a solid plutonium core. The first of that type to be detonated was the
          Gadget
          in the Trinity nuclear test less than a month earlier on 16 July at the Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range
          in
          New Mexico. Two more were detonated during the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll in 1946, and
          some 120 were produced between 1947 and 1949, when it was superseded by the Mark 4 nuclear bomb. The Fat Man
          was
          retired in 1950.

        <h2> Early decisions</h2>
        <p>
          Robert Oppenheimer held conferences in Chicago in June 1942, prior to the Army taking over wartime atomic
          research, and in Berkeley, California, in July, at which various engineers and physicists discussed nuclear
          bomb
          design issues. They chose a gun-type design in which two sub-critical masses would be brought together by
          firing a
          "bullet" into a "target".[1] Richard C. Tolman suggested an implosion-type nuclear weapon, but the proposal
          attracted little interest.[2]
          The feasibility of a plutonium bomb was questioned in 1942. Wallace Akers, the director of the British "Tube
          Alloys" project, told James Bryant Conant on 14 November that James Chadwick had "concluded that plutonium
          might
          not be a practical fissionable material for weapons because of impurities."[3] Conant consulted Ernest
          Lawrence
          and Arthur Compton, who acknowledged that their scientists at Berkeley and Chicago respectively knew about the
          problem, but they could offer no ready solution. Conant informed Manhattan Project director Brigadier General
          Leslie R. Groves Jr., who in turn assembled a special committee consisting of Lawrence, Compton, Oppenheimer,
          and
          McMillan to examine the issue. The committee concluded that any problems could be overcome simply by requiring
          higher purity.[4]

          Oppenheimer reviewed his options in early 1943 and gave priority to the gun-type weapon,[2] but he created the
          E-5
          Group at the Los Alamos Laboratory under Seth Neddermeyer to investigate implosion as a hedge against the
          threat
          of pre-detonation. Implosion-type bombs were determined to be significantly more efficient in terms of
          explosive
          yield per unit mass of fissile material in the bomb, because compressed fissile materials react more rapidly
          and
          therefore more completely. Nonetheless, it was decided that the plutonium gun would receive the bulk of the
          research effort, since it was the project with the least uncertainty involved. It was assumed that the uranium
          gun-type bomb could be easily adapted from it.[5]

        <h2>Naming</h2>
        <P>
          The gun-type and implosion-type designs were codenamed "Thin Man" and "Fat Man" respectively. These code names
          were created by Robert Serber, a former student of Oppenheimer's who worked on the Manhattan Project.

          He chose them based on their design shapes; the Thin Man was a very long device, and the name came from the
          Dashiell Hammett detective novel The Thin Man and series of movies. The Fat Man was round and fat and was
          named
          after Sydney Greenstreet's character in Hammett's The Maltese Falcon. Little Boy came last as a variation of
          Thin
          Man.[6]

        <h2>Development</h2>
        <p>Neddermeyer discarded Serber and Tolman's initial concept of implosion as assembling a series of pieces in
          favor
          of one in which a hollow sphere was imploded by an explosive shell. He was assisted in this work by Hugh
          Bradner,
          Charles Critchfield, and John Streib. L. T. E. Thompson was brought in as a consultant, and discussed the
          problem
          with Neddermeyer in June 1943. Thompson was skeptical that an implosion could be made sufficiently symmetric.

        <P>
          Oppenheimer arranged for Neddermeyer and Edwin McMillan to visit the National Defense Research Committee's
          Explosives Research Laboratory near the laboratories of the Bureau of Mines in Bruceton, Pennsylvania (a
          Pittsburgh suburb), where they spoke to George Kistiakowsky and his team. But Neddermeyer's efforts in July
          and
          August at imploding tubes to produce cylinders tended to produce objects that resembled rocks. Neddermeyer was
          the
          only person who believed that implosion was practical, and only his enthusiasm kept the project alive.[7]</p>
